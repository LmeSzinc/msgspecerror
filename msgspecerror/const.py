    An enumeration of all possible `ValidationError` forms from msgspec,

    """
    Format: "Expected `<A>`, got `<B>` - at <Path>"

    This is the most common category of error, triggered when a decoded value's
    type is incompatible with the expected schema type.
    Note that if <path> is root, " - at <path>" won't be shown

    Examples:
    - "Expected `int`, got `str` - at `$.age`"
    - "Expected `str`, got `int` - at $.name"
    - "Expected `MyCustomClass`, got `str` - at `$.custom_field`"
    - "Expected `int`, got `str` - at `$.type`" (for tagged unions)

    Triggered by:
    1.  **General Mismatch**: A decoded value's basic type (str, int, list, etc.)
        doesn't match the target Python type.
    2.  **MsgPack-Specific Mismatch**: A msgpack-encoded value (e.g., a msgpack int)
        cannot be coerced into the target Python type (e.g., str).
    3.  **Custom Type Mismatch**: A `dec_hook` returns an object that is not an
        instance of the expected custom type.
    4.  **Tag Type Mismatch**: The tag field in a tagged union has an incorrect
        type (e.g., an `int` was found when a `str` was expected).

    """
    Format: "Expected `<type>` - at <Path>"

    A type mismatch where the decoder encounters a syntactically valid but
    structurally incompatible token, but the actual type cannot be included
    in the error message. This always lacks the ", got `<B>`" portion that
    distinguishes it from TYPE_MISMATCH.

    Examples:
    - "Expected `str` - at `$.kind`" (JSON: tag field value is non-string)
    - "Expected `int` - at `$.kind`" (JSON: tag field value is non-int)
    - "Expected `str` - at `key` in `$`" (convert: dict key is non-string)

    Triggered by:
    1.  **Tag Value Mismatch** (JSON): The tag field value in a tagged union
        has the wrong JSON token type (e.g., a number where a string tag
        is expected, or vice versa).
    2.  **Map Key Mismatch** (convert): A dict key in `msgspec.convert()` or
        equivalent path is not a string.
    3.  **Token Type Mismatch** (JSON): A JSON token (parsed as int/str/...)
        has the wrong type for the decoder position.
